# 🎓 College Database Project (MySQL)

A simple yet structured SQL project that simulates a **college student database**, built to demonstrate data creation, insertion, and querying using MySQL.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Created and managed a relational database (`college`)
- Defined schema with constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`)
- Inserted sample student records
- Implemented complex queries using:
  - `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`
  - `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`
  - `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
  - `AVG()` aggregate function

---

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Covered
- DDL (CREATE, DROP)
- DML (INSERT)
- DQL (SELECT)
- Aggregate functions
- Filtering and sorting data
- Data range selection

---

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench or any SQL client.
2. Run `college_schema.sql` to create the database and tables.
3. Run `sample_data.sql` to insert sample records.
4. Run `queries.sql` to test and analyze the data.

## 🧾 Future Enhancements (for Version 2.0)
- Add a `course` and `department` table.
- Implement `JOIN` queries.
- Add views, stored procedures, and triggers.
- Include analytical reports (e.g., top scorers per city).
